# ACC Basketball Analysis

This project analyzes scoring data from ACC men’s basketball conference games during the 2025–2026 season.  
The goal is to explore how points are distributed among players and teams and to visualize scoring patterns.


## Contents

- **Bench_Depth_Analysis.Rmd** – R Markdown file with initial data cleaning and scoring analysis.  
- **Class_Analysis.Rmd** – Second R Markdown file with additional visualizations and deeper insights.   


## Key Questions Explored

- How many points did each player score in conference play?  
- What share of team scoring comes from top scorers?  
- Which teams are more “top-heavy” in scoring vs. balanced?  
- Are there any trends or patterns in scoring across the season?  

## Tools Used

- **R**: tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, stringr), rvest, janitor, R Markdown   
- Data manipulation, visualization, and reproducible reporting
