# ACC Basketball Analysis

This project analyzes scoring data from ACC men’s basketball conference games during the 2025–2026 season.  
The goal is to explore how points are distributed among players and teams and to visualize scoring patterns.


## Contents

- **pbp_analysis.Rmd** - Rmd file with play-by-play used for coaching timeout and foul strategy
- **UNC_Duke_Analysis.Rmd** - Rmd file with UNC vs Duke specific analysis (2005-2025)


## Key Questions Explored

- How many points did each player score in conference play?  
- What share of team scoring comes from top scorers?  
- Which teams are more “top-heavy” in scoring vs. balanced?  
- Are there any trends or patterns in scoring across the season?
- What patterns emerge from tracking timeouts as a result of a run?
- What are the different coaching strategies for pulling players due to foul trouble?
- What trends exist in UNC vs Duke games?

## Tools Used

- **R**: tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, readr, stringr), rvest, janitor, rleid, R Markdown   
- Data manipulation, visualization, and reproducible reporting
